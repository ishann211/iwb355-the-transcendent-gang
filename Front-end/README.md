# Introduction


Our healthcare patient management application allows patients to register and book their appointments with doctors. The application is built using Next.js for the frontend and Ballerina for the backend. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

User and Patient Registration

Next.js Frontend: Both users and patients can register through a responsive form that collects necessary personal information (name, contact details, etc.). The form is designed for easy navigation and a smooth user experience.
Ballerina Backend: The registration data is sent to the backend via API, where Ballerina processes and securely stores patient information in a database. Sensitive data like passwords are encrypted for privacy.

Booking Appointments

Next.js Frontend: Patients can view doctorsâ€™ availability in a calendar-like interface, select a suitable time, and book appointments directly. The interface updates dynamically to show available slots and avoid scheduling conflicts.
Ballerina Backend: The backend handles the scheduling logic, ensuring no double bookings. Once an appointment is booked, the backend updates the doctorâ€™s schedule and stores appointment details in the database.
